<p><code>nlocks</code>: Native spinlocks for Erlang</p>

<hr>

<p>An experiment on Erlang native spinlocks:
* Able to guarantee exclusive access to shared resources
* Not dependent on a single process (no flooded mailbox as a bottleneck)
* Able to deal with brutally killed processes that still held unreleased locks (more below)</p>

<pre lang="erlang">
Lock = nlocks:new(),
Transaction = fun() -&gt;
    io:format("hello from ~p at ~p~n", [self(), os:timestamp()]),
    timer:sleep(100)
end,

[spawn(fun () -&gt; nlocks:transaction(Lock, Transaction) end) || _ &lt;- lists:seq(1, 4)].

<h3><a name="Brutal_kills_and_unreleased_locks">Brutal kills and unreleased locks</a></h3><p>
Hackish solution. Other than setting up some sort of monitor in the Erlang land, I found no practical way to deal with these other than making use of _ownership_ objects, references to which should never leave the process under which they were created; the release therefore becomes dependent on the garbage collector calling their destructor, but this also makes it more convenient for regular kills that forget to clean up.</p>

<h3><a name="Ownership_objects">Ownership objects</a></h3>
<pre lang="c++">
struct Ownership {
    ERL_NIF_TERM pid;
    Lock* lock;
};
</pre>

<p>* They're created for lock acquisition in order to deal with the above problem
* They should never leave their owning process
* On successful acquisition, they link themselves to the lock and force it to live as long as they live
* They guarantee only the lock owner can release the lock
* No explicit destruction needed</p>

<h3><a name="Lock_objects">Lock objects</a></h3>
<pre lang="c++">
struct Lock {
    std::atomic&lt;Ownership*&gt; ownership;
};
</pre>

<p>* They keep an atomic pointer either set to null (free) or to the ownership object's address (locked)
* Can be shared between local processes through messages, ETS tables, etc.
* No explicit destruction needed</p>

<h3><a name="The_spinning">The spinning</a></h3><p>
* It uses C++ 11 <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/compare_exchangek">compare_exchange_weak</a>
* For each attempt, a new NIF call is scheduled; this brings some overhead to the table but it's crucial to play nice with the VM
* If the timeout is other than 'infinity', for each attempt it compares the deadline against the current <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/steady_clock">steady_clock</a> value; this feels excessive and might hurt performance.</p>
